## Using data with RAPIDS container

The RAPIDS container hosted on our [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rapidsai/rapidsai/) has notebooks that use the following datasets.
1. Download the datasets inside the container using `wget` or to the local host and use a docker volume mount to `/rapids/data/`
2. Decompress the dataset using `tar xzvf NAME_OF_DATASET.tgz`
3. Confirm that the following directory structure exists in `/rapids/data/`
```
/rapids/data/mortgage/acq/         <- all acquisition data
/rapids/data/mortgage/perf/        <- all performance data
/rapids/data/mortgage/names.csv    <- lender name normalization
```
